<h1 align="center">LDash - Lightweight Dashboard</h1>

Yes, it's another self-hosted dashboard. But this one is made to be as lightweight as possible.

Because of this, LDash works completely in your web browser. It doesn't need a server to run, so it comes **without** one.

# Quick start

Copy everything from live demo inside `public` directory to your statically hosted directory :)
everything is configurable by `config.json`, use `config.example.json` for reference.

Note: you may remove excess files to save extra space: 
- `assets/examples` (~5.6Mb), 
- `config.example.json` (200Kb)
- `background.js` (60Kb)

# Requirements:

### Minimal

- web browser with javascript enabled

### Recommended

- web server with http2 & etag cache
- any modern browserbu
